    "  # Already-used names will be \"uniquified\".\n",
    "  c_1 = tf.constant(2, name=\"c\")  # => operation named \"c_1\"\n",
    "  # Name scopes add a prefix to all operations created in the same context.\n",
    "  with tf.name_scope(\"outer\"):\n",
    "    c_2 = tf.constant(2, name=\"c\")  # => operation named \"outer/c\"\n",
    "    # Name scopes nest like paths in a hierarchical file system.\n",
    "    with tf.name_scope(\"inner\"):\n",
    "      c_3 = tf.constant(3, name=\"c\")  # => operation named \"outer/inner/c\"\n",
    "    # Exiting a name scope context will return to the previous prefix.\n",

    "    # Already-used name scopes will be \"uniquified\".\n",
